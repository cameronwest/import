Frequently Asked Questions
=================
- How do I indicate an element field type in the CSV file?
	- Import utilizes "search", so it can be anything that makes it unique
- How would I indicate a multiplicity of element field types in the CSV file?
	- Just separate them by comma
- How should I write my CSVs so parent & child entries/categories work properly?
	- Write it like Ancestor/Child/Entry and connect as "Ancestor". Do note that "Entries in this section have their own URLs" should be checked.
- Do parent entries already need to exist before I import a CSV? Or can they be created form the came CSV import as their child entries?
	- The entry should exist, but if it comes in the row before then it will exist and it will pass.
- Is there an "Export" feature so I can get to data that is more complete in the DB than in my CSV file?
	- No, but there is the "Export" plugin that can be found here: https://github.com/boboldehampsink/export
